# Director Rework

This mod aims to diversify enemy/elite/boss spawns, so instead of getting a horde of pests you get multiple enemy types. Does the same with elites, minimizing hordes of mending for example. Rerolls enemies/elites more often. Yes this applies to teleporter bosses as well (multiple boss types per tp - configurable). Works with all combat directors (normal runs, simulacrum, alt game modes, etc...).
